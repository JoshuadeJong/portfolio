    "I currently work at Expeditors Seattle as a software developer for the Enterprise Monitoring team. I have been working with the team to improve the performance of their java code base. So far I've improved multiple code blocks down to O(n) or O(log(n)) time! I have also been helping the team develop their CI/CD pipelines and infrastructure for the release of their Elastic Search based monitoring solution.",
    "I originally started my career at Colorado State University where I studied mathematics and worked as a researcher in a chemistry lab. It was here where I found a passion for coding by developing machine vision tools and numerical models of experiments. After university I started work as a data analyst where I built predictive models, and built an item recommendation system using machine learning!",
