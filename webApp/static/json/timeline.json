The contest was a rush of brain power and adrenaline colliding to form a frantic group solving session. With no prep and just the pens in our pockets were we able to finish before all the other team. Well frankly quite a bit ahead of the other teams and it was quite worrisome. The following day we found out that we not only finished first but got every question correct! This caused quite the controversy as we were the new university, beat the reigning champions of 5 years, and no other team came close."
