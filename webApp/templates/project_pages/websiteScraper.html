    As a quick weekend project I spent time learning BeautifulSoup, a popular python library for extracting data from HTML and XML files.
    As my Mother was looking at starting a Tea company I figured I would make the learning experience useful for at least her.
    To do this I pulled data from one of the largest tea distributors in the USA, Dethlefsen & Balk.
    From their website I pulled the following data:
</p>
<ul class="ul-bullets">
    <li>
        <b>Product Number</b> (string)
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Product's Name</b> (string)
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Product Description</b> (string)
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Quantity per Container</b> (string)
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Min and Max Brew Times</b> (int)
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Min and Max Brew Temperatures</b> (int)
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Serving Size</b> (int)
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Organic Status</b> (boolean)
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Aggregated data was then formatted and outputted as a excel spreadsheet for easy of access.
</p>

    The project provided a great way to learn about BeautifulSoup and some good practice.
    While not the most beautiful of code, my repository provides a good reference on how to use BeautifulSoup.

    <b>Note to Reader:</b>
    After collecting data on tea and copious amounts of tea samples I have realized the vast majority of "Independent" Tea stores sell repackaged tea from Dethlefsen & Balk.
    You'r favorite expensive tea store is most likely selling the same tea as the tea store across town; or better yet you might just find it online.
