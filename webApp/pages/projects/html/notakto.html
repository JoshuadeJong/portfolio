    Notakto is a variant of tic-tac-toe which can be played across one or several boards.
    Both players use the same piece, an \"X\", with the goal of forcing the opponent to make a three-in-a-row of Xs.
    The game is traditional played on a 3x3 board, however any NxM board is possible where N,M >= 3.
    The game has a distinct advantage over tic-tac-toe as there will always be a winner, however the winner is often determined by who went first and the size of the board.
