                                I took a long weekend with a group of friends to experience east coast snow for the first time!
                                We rented a rustic wood burning cabin near Leavenworth, a American town with the facade of a Bavarian village.
                                We got two days of skiing in; the first one was sunny with nice groomed runs, and the second was blizzard conditions with deep powder.
                                The trip was a lot of fun, however digging my car out after a full day of skiing was not so much fun.

                                As it was early in the season there was just enough snow for my favorites run to be open.
                                However, the lack of snow didn't stop me from getting 4 days of skiing in!
                                I started to learn how to carve like a pro and learned how cold it can get 14000 feet.
                                Man, that was a cold day.

                                The trip was a blast and something I would do again in a heartbeat, maybe I would bring a larger car next time.

                                As part of my last semester in university I had to take a required course I had been delaying for far to long.
                                This course was Plant Sciences 101, and to pass the course I would have to write a long paper on the medical or social impacts of a plant species.
                                However, as a mathematician this project did not excite me one bit.
                                So after a brief talk with the professor and ended up modeling the Neolithic Transition with his research team.
                                The research was successful and I was saved the horror of reading about plants for the whole semester.

                                I had the honour of working in a chemistry lab as a mathematician and software developer.
                                During my time there I built software implementing machine learning techniques to help capture, processed, and analyze data.
                                I also derived partial differential equations to model and explain different chemical experiments.
                                While I was unable to attend, the research won awards at the 2019 Joint Mathematics Meeting in Baltimore.

                                As I had done a wide range of research at this point for the department I was asked if I would like to represent the university in New Mexico.
                                The university end up sending 5 of us out to give presentation and attend talks from other universities.
                                While the lectures were all a hit, the peak of the trip was the mathematics contest.
                                The contest was a rush of brain power and adrenaline colliding to form a frantic group solving session.
                                With no prep and just the pens in our pockets were we able to finish before all the other team.
                                Well frankly quite a bit ahead of the other teams and it was quite worrisome.
                                The following day we found out that we not only finished first but got every question correct!
                                This caused quite the controversy as we were the new university, beat the reigning champions of 5 years, and no other team came close.

                                As I have always enjoyed the outdoors and was being a bit adventurous at the time, I took up a friends offer to go 4 wheeling in Moab.
                                I had never been 4 wheeling before so I wasn't sure for what I signed up.
                                To put it frankly; the shaking of the vehicle, crawling over once impassable obstacles, and the breath taking scenery made for one of the best experiences of my life.

                                With a building passion for computational maths I started looking for different topics which may interest me.
                                As patterns had always caught my interest the thoughts of constructing sequences with no arithmetic sequences catch my attention.
                                During this project I learned a lot about programming and eventually made a SAT Solver to traverse my tree of possible solutions.
                                While I didn't make any break throughs during this project, I was able to verify some of the previous records!

                                This was my first judged poster conference and while I had done a lot of public speaking the thought of being judge was nerve racking.
                                I had made poster for my recent work on Graph Theory and also had a poster I helped a friend build on Laplacian Smoothing.
                                What I thought would be a train wreck turned into a very fun experience where I got to share my work and network with new people.
                                As a plus I found out I had placed in second for my Graph Theory poster and my friend had won first place!

                                While taking a graduate level combinatorics course at came across an interesting idea relating to graph theory.
                                After taking to the professor about the idea I started to pursue research in the area.
                                While I did not make any break throughs in the field, I was able to find a generalized method to solve a wide range of existing problems.
                                I later presented these ideas at multiple conferences and published a paper detailing the method.

                                However, that all changed when I went to the JMM.
                                Seeing a conference hall full of people who also shared the same passion as me was eye opening.
                                While I didn't present, the act of attending the conference showed me that I still had a lot to learn and the variety of subjects in mathematics.

                                After helping out CSU's Math Club for a few semesters I've decided to step up and take a leadership position.
                                As the club's membership was dwindling, I made it a focus to reinvent the club's image and thus audience.
                                This wasn't going to be a club with monthly lectures and poor retention.
                                While there I raised participation from 5 people a month to 30 people a week, funded 25 students to attend national mathematics conferences, ran 3 large department parties, and changed the perception of the CSU mathematics department.
